# **API-Example (iOS)**

ApsaraVideo Player SDK iOS Sample Project

## **üìñ Project Overview**

This project is an iOS sample application for the ApsaraVideo Player SDK, developed in Objective-C, aimed at helping developers quickly understand and integrate the core features provided by the SDK.

The project adopts a **plugin-based architecture**, offers excellent **extensibility** and **maintainability**.

## **‚ú® Feature Highlights**

### **üéØ Single-Function Demonstration Design**

- **Focused on single functions** - Each module demonstrates only one core feature, making it easy to understand and verify quickly.
- **Minimal code implementation** - Only essential logic is retained, eliminating redundant code to improve example readability.
- **Unified access entry** - Supports schema-based routing for decoupled inter-module navigation.

### **üîß Technical Features**

- **Plugin-based architecture** - Each functional plugin is independently packaged for easier management and reuse.
- **CocoaPods integration** - Plugin management is based on CocoaPods, supporting independent development and testing.
- **Runtime discovery** - Automatically discovers plugins without manual registration, enabling dynamic expansion.
- **Internationalization support** - Supports automatic switching between Chinese and English for multi-language environments.
- **Flexible SDK switching** - Seamlessly switch between different versions of the ApsaraVideo Player SDK.

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture**

This project uses a plugin-based structure, with a clear structure and easy scalability:

> üìå The functional modules will be continuously expanded according to business and demonstration needs. The table only lists some representative modules. For more functions, please follow the project's subsequent updates.

## **üîê License Configuration Instructions**

This project does not include an official license. Please complete the following configuration to enable full functionality.

### ‚úÖ Pre-deployment Setup

1. **Obtain and Integrate License**

   Please refer to the [Bind a license](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/apsara-video-sdk/user-guide/access-to-license) to obtain an authorized SDK license and follow the instructions to integrate it.

2. **Update License Information**

   Open the file `Example/Example/Info.plist` and locate the following lines. Replace them with your own license details:

```xml
	<key>AlivcLicenseKey</key>
	<string>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</string>
	<key>AlivcLicenseFile</key>
	<string>YOUR_LICENSE_FILE_PATH</string>
```

* **License Key**: Enter the license key string obtained from the console.
* **License File**: Provide the license file name (e.g., `license.crt`) and place this `.crt` file into the `Example/Example/` directory.

> üí° Tip: Make sure the `.crt` file is correctly added to your Xcode project and included in the build process.

3. **Rebuild and Run the Project**

   After completing the configuration, rebuild and run the project. The SDK will automatically load the license and activate all features.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: If the license is not configured correctly, player functionality may be limited or unavailable.
