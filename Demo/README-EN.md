```xml
	<key>AlivcLicenseKey</key>
	<string>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</string>
	<key>AlivcLicenseFile</key>
	<string>YOUR_LICENSE_FILE_PATH</string>
```

> üí° Tip: Make sure the `.crt` file is correctly added to your Xcode project and included in the build process.

3. **Rebuild and Run the Project**

   After completing the configuration, rebuild and run the project. The SDK will automatically load the license and activate all features.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: If the license is not configured correctly, player functionality may be limited or unavailable.
